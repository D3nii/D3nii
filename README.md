## About me

I'm Danyal Jamil, a Software Engineering Student and a Machine Learning Enthusiast :robot: and on top of everything, a professional procrastinator. 

I, sometimes, blog about ML and Web, `basically whatever I want!`


## Things I am passionate about

- Deep Learning.
- Web Development.
- Empowering the Community. :muscle:

## Get in touch

- Your future employee on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d3ni/).
- And of course GitHub you're already on (Recursion).

## Fun fact

- I like to explore new student opportunities. Get in touch with me on Twitter to talk about any, I'll be happy to have a conversation.

D3nii/D3nii is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile and it's heavily inspired by sagar-viradiya's profile.
