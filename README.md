## About me

I'm Danyal Jamil, a Software Engineering Student and a Machine Learning Enthusiast :robot:. I'm very passionate in using both these together to make an impact on the world.

I, sometimes, blog about ML and Web, `basically whatever I want!`:grin:


## Things I am passionate about

- Deep Learning :robot:
- Web Development 💻
- Empowering the Community :muscle:
